This repository holds a project I completed for my Computer Science II course. 

**Description:**
The project acts like a movie ticket reservation system. A known system user - found in userdb.dat - can: reserve seats, modify an order, -
and delete an order in one of three auditoriums. If the user attempts to reserve a seat that has already been taken, the program will offer
the 'best available' seat to the user. Additionally, there is an admin user that has special priveleges: they can print a report of the 
earnings from the three rooms, as well as the ability to exit the program.

Notes on the data structures used
- The auditoriums are linked lists connected vertically and horizontally to allow for easy traversal.
- The user information is stored in hashmaps, with the user's orders being an arrayList index element.

Please feel free to reach out to me for any further questions
